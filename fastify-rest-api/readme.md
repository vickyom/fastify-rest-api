# How to Create Your First REST API With Fastify

# Requirements and Installation

To follow this tutorial, you'll need:

1. Latest Node.js version
2. Tool for sending requests, such as [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

Next, make sure to create an empty Node.js project. If you don't have one yet, you can use the following command to set up your project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Lastly, we want to add this Fastify dependency to our project.

```bash
npm i fastify --save
```
